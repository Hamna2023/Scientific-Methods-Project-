## Research Questions:
The questions that we will be focusing on are as follows:
### Understanding the impact of economic conditions of a country on life expectancy at
birth?
For this question we will be looking at the life expectancy for all the major countries at
birth and then compare it with GDP per capita (US$) as a measure for economic growth
for those countries for the year 2014. We expect a positive correlation between the two
variables. A country with higher GDP per capita will definitely have a better life
expectancy at birth as compared to those with lower GDP per capita.
### Does having a higher GDP per capita mean allocating higher budget for health and
well being for population of a country?
In this question we will analyze whether there exists any prominent correlation between
the two variables by comparing percentage of GDP spent on the health expenditure for
countries India, Pakistan, China, and Sri Lanka with China and Sri Lanka being the
developed countries and India and Pakistan developing countries. Our initial hypothesis is
that countries with higher GDP per capita will spend more on the health sector for their
population.
### How do financial conditions of a country affect the stunting rate of a country?
Economic conditions of a country are often also considered as a cause of poor nutritional
outcomes; the stunting growth of children of that country. For countries with higher GDP
per capita i.e., the developed countries we expect lower stunting rates as compared to the
developing and under developed countries. To test the hypothesis, we will analyze data
through graphs for 243 countries and draw conclusions whether there exists a correlation
between the two variables.
### What effect does having financial stability have on the standard living of a countryâ€™s
population?
With an increase in GDP per capita, standard of living generally rises and people have
more resources to tackle communicable and/or non-communicable diseases and therefore
we expect that as GDP per capita increases the mortality rate of a country decreases.
Thus, proving that better economic conditions lead to better living standards improving
the population health.
### Do countries with better economic conditions have lower infant mortality?
Infant mortality rate indicates how many babies die in the first year of their lives out of
1000 live births. We expect that increasing GDP per capita will decrease infant mortality
rate. We test our hypothesis on countries India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and China with data
from world bank over the span of 60 years.
